##What are the most/ least popular stem fields female graduates are coming out with?
  
"For the total time span from the year 2000 to 2015, three majors had
over 50 percent of the graduating class being female. Those three are
psychology at an average of 77%, biological and agricultural sciences
with an average of 58%, and social sciences with an average of 54%. 
And the lowest percentage of female graduates came from computer science
(21%) and engineering (20%).
This could indicate that under the STEM fields, women are more likely to
major under fields that deal more with humanity and the environment instead
of computer-driven majors. "

###Do we foresee potential growth in the future based on the data?
  
  "Over the 15 years, all the majors experienced little growth or shrinkage.
  The major with the largest variation in percentage from 2000 to 2015 was
  computer science, the female graduates dropped 10%. 
Based on the data we don't see much growth across all the majors listed,
for a majority of majors there has been close to no movement. This could
be from individuals choosing other paths besides a college degree to learn
skills for the workforce or dropouts."
